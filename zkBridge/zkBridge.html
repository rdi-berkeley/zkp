            <p class="text-justify">We present zkBridge, the first  trustless, permissionless, extensible, universal, and efficient cross-chain bridge. zkBridge leverages zk-SNARKs for block header relay, where non-interactive proofs help achieve cryptographic assurance of security without any external trust assumptions such as a central or PoS committee, and succinctness helps significantly reduce on-chain verification cost. In the underlying proof protocol, we first propose deVirgo, a novel distributed succinct proof protocol that is orders-of-magnitude faster than existing solutions for the workload in zkBridge.  We further apply Groth16 for recursive proof that lowers the on-chain verification cost. With a modular design, zkBridge enables a broad spectrum of applications, including message passing, token transferring, and other computational logic operating on state changes from different chains. We have already implemented zkBridge between certain chains and evaluated its end-to-end performance. We encourage community members to join us to extend zkBridge to other chains; <a href="https://forms.gle/WBx25gBoMZjXsMTJ8 ">please fill in the form</a> if you are interested in contributing to this project towards building a universal, secure foundation for multi-chain interoperability.

      <h1>Our Advantages Compared with Other Cross-chain Bridges</h1>
      <br/><br/>

<p class="mb-5 w-75 m-auto">Cross-chain bridges enable secure and efficient communication between two blockchains. <br/>It has been widely acknowledged that the blockchain ecosystem will get into a multi-chain future.<br/> Thus cross-chain bridges are extremely critical for multi-chain interoperability.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/brg.jpg" class="w-50 rounded"></p>
<br/>
<br/>


<p class="mb-5 w-75 m-auto">There are quite a few cross-chain bridge projects deployed today.
<br/>
However, most of them suffer from either inefficiency or poor security.
<br/>
Till the time of writing (Sep 2022), more than $1 billion has been stolen by attackers from bridges.

<br/>
<br/>
<p class="mb-5 w-75 m-auto">Compared with existing cross-chain bridge projects, the overall advantages of zkBridge can be summarized as follows:</p>

<div class="row align-items-center">
          <h3 class="mb-3">1. Trustless and Secure</h3>
          <p class="mb-3">The proofs of a valid block header on remote blockchains are provided by zk-SNARKs, <br/>and thus no extra trust assumptions are introduced.<br/> As long as the security of both the connected blockchains themselves and the underlying light-client protocol is guaranteed,<br/> and there is at least one honest node in the block header relay network, zkBridge is secure. <br/>It implies that zkBridge achieves the best possible security. <br/><br/> </p>
      </div>
<br/> 

<div class="row align-items-center">
          <h3 class="mb-3">2. Permissionless and Decentralized</h3>
          <p class="mb-3"> Any node can freely join the network to relay the block headers, generate proofs, and claim the rewards. <br/>  Due to the elimination of the commonly-used central or Proof-of-Stake style committee for block header validation, <br/> zkBridge also enjoys better decentralization.<br/><br/></p>
          </div>
<br/> 

<div class="row align-items-center">
          <h3 class="mb-3">3. Extensible</h3>
          <p class="mb-3"> zkBridge allows maximum extensibility, <br/> in that applications can invoke the updater contract to retrieve verified block headers, <br/> and then perform their application-specific verification and functionality in addition for wider usage.<br/>  (e.g., verifying a transaction through auxiliary Merkle proof) <br/>  By separating the bridge from application-specific logic, <br/> zkBridge makes it easy to enable additional applications on top of the bridge.<br/><br/></p>
      </div>
<br/> 

<div class="row align-items-center">
          <h3 class="mb-3">4. Universal</h3>
          <p class="mb-3"> The block header relay network and the underlying proof scheme in zkBridge can connect <br/>  almost any two blockchains together without triggering high cost,<br/>   making the cross-chain bridge universal. <br/><br/></p>
      </div>
<br/> 

<div class="row align-items-center">
          <h3 class="mb-3">5. Efficient</h3>
          <p class="mb-3">With our highly optimized recursive proof scheme,<br/>  block headers can be relayed within a short time (usually tens of seconds for proof generation), <br/> and the relayed information can be quickly finalized as long as the proof passes the verification, <br/> thus supporting fast and flexible transaction processing. <br/> <br/><br/><br/> In summary, our completely new design is a huge leap towards building a secure, trustless foundation for blockchain interoperability.<br/><br/></p>      </div>

      <h1>Design Rationale and the Underlying Proof System</h1>
      <p class="mb-5 w-75 m-auto">In the following, we introduce the design rationale and our highly optimized proof system of zkBridge in more detail.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-3">zkBridge Protocol</h4>
          <p class="mb-3">Concretely, zkBridge consists of the following components: a block header relay network and an updater contract. In the block header relay network, relayers retrieve the block headers from the sender blockchain C1, generate proofs of validity of the block headers, and send the headers along with the proofs to the updater contract which is set up on the receiver blockchain C2.  For the updater contract, the corresponding block headers of C1 are stored once the associated proofs pass the verification. Furthermore, the updater contract also maintains a light-client state. Once a new block header is added, the contract renews the light-client state just like other light clients on C1, and updates the current main chain of C1. The updater contract also exposes a function to applications, through which an application on C2 can obtain the block header of a given height on C1. After getting the block header information, the application can do more verification (such as a specific transaction) and build their own applications.</p>

          <h4>deVirgo and Recursive Proof</h4>
          <p>To make the underlying zk-SNARK system compatible with on-chain usage, both fast proof generation and low on-chain proof verification cost are required. We use a 2-layer recursive proof system to satisfy both properties. In the first layer, we present deVirgo, a distributed version of the Virgo proof system. deVirgo combines distributed sumcheck and distributed polynomial commitment to achieve optimal parallelism, and is able to accelerate the proof generation by orders of magnitude when running on distributed machines. However, the verification cost of deVirgo proof on-chain is still too high to be put into practice, and thus we apply a recursive second layer to address the issue. In the second layer, we use Groth16 to prove that the previously generated proof by deVirgo indeed proves the corresponding block headers, which significantly reduces on-chain verification gas cost from ~80M to ~221K. Through the 2-layer recursive proof scheme, we perfectly achieve fast proof generation and low verification cost at the same time.</p>
